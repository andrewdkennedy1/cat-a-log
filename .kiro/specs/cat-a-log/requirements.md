## Introduction

CAT-a-log is a lightweight, personal Progressive Web App (PWA) designed for tracking cat encounters. The application serves as a digital diary for cat enthusiasts to log, map, and manage their feline encounters.

3. WHEN a photo exceeds 5MB THEN the system SHALL automatically resize it to ~1600px longest edge using Canvas
4. WHEN the user adds a photo THEN the system SHALL store it as a Blob in IndexedDB with a unique photoBlobId
5. WHEN logging an encounter THEN the system SHALL provide an optional comment field for free text

### Requirement 4
